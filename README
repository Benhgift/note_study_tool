Pass in notes and it'll store them. Then you can:
    - retrieve a note for study
    - build a notes file from all of them

Which notes should we study?
    - the note with the highest importance.
        imporance = time_since_review * imporance_scale 
            importance_scale changes with user saying note was easy

    - parent notes first
        - when we study a note, reset its age to 0
            - increase importance of child notes
